*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by codewithhippo17.*

## Description

**netPractice** is a hands-on networking fundamentals project from the 42 curriculum. The goal is to configure small-scale networks and understand how TCP/IP addressing works in practice. Through 10 progressive levels, you'll master essential networking concepts including IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, routing, and network segmentation.

This project provides a browser-based training interface where you configure network topologies, assign IP addresses, and set up routing rules. Each level increases in complexity, challenging you to apply networking principles to solve real-world connectivity problems.

By completing this project, you'll gain practical understanding of how data flows through networks, how devices communicate within and across networks, and how network engineers design and troubleshoot IP networks.

Instructions
Running the Interface

Open index.html in your web browser.

Complete levels 1–10 by configuring network parameters (IP addresses, subnet masks, routes).

Exporting Configurations

After each level, click “Get my config” to export the configuration.

Save each file as levelX.json (X = 1–10).

Place all JSON files at the root of your repository.

Submission

## Resources

### Networking Concepts Studied

This project covers the following core networking concepts:

- **TCP/IP Addressing**: Understanding IPv4 address structure, network and host portions
- **Subnet Mask**: Calculating network boundaries, subnet division, and CIDR notation
- **Default Gateway**: Configuring routers as gateways for inter-network communication
- **Routers**: Routing tables, static routes, and packet forwarding decisions
- **Switches**: Layer 2 switching and local network connectivity
- **OSI Layers**: Focus on Layer 2 (Data Link), Layer 3 (Network), and Layer 4 (Transport)
- **Network Segmentation**: VLANs and logical network separation
- **ARP and DHCP**: Address resolution and dynamic IP configuration
- **DNS**: Domain name resolution
- **NAT**: Network Address Translation for internet connectivity

### AI tools were used in this project for the following purposes:
used AI tools mainly as helpers to extract *Wisdom* from videos and find the best resources to support my learning. AI also gave a hand in structuring the docs and making explanations a bit clearer, but it wasn’t doing the thinking for me. Everything else solving the network configurations, drawing my own diagrams, asking questions to peers, Googling, reading, and really understanding the concepts was all done by me.
