# ARP and DHCP

While applications use **IP addresses**, network hardware operates with **MAC addresses**. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** resolves an **IP address** to its corresponding **MAC address** and stores the result in an **ARP table** for faster future access.  

To simplify configuration, **DHCP** automatically assigns **IP addresses** and essential network settings to devices for a limited time.
