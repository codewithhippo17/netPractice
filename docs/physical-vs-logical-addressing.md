# Physical vs Logical Addressing

Every device has a **MAC address**, a unique hardware identifier used for communication inside a local network. Since **MAC addresses** are not practical for large-scale networks, **IP addresses** are used as logical and flexible identifiers. The **Subnet Mask** determines whether a destination is local or remote. Remote traffic is forwarded to the **Default Gateway**.
